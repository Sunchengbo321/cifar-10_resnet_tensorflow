This implementation of resnet and its variants is designed to be straightforward and friendly to new ResNet users. 
You can train a resnet on cifar10 by downloading and running the code. 
####If you like the code, please star it! You are welcome to post questions and suggestions on my github.
in this repo i implemented Identity Mappings  introduce by microsoft researchers.
and i also implemented new res block resnet with elu.
